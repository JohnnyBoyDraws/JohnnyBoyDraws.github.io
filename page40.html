	<h3><font size="+2">19, May 2023</font></h3>

	<p><font size="+1"><h2></h2>Page 40. Another 160 and we'll have something close to a finished first book. That may seem like a long way out, and it is, but the book will probably be finished before these weekly page releases catch up to it. I'm able to stay ahead of the game a lot better now, and besides, it may be in my best interest to only post the first half of the book online anyways. That way people actually have a reason to purchase a physical copy. I'm not sure what I'll end up doing to be honest, ultimately what I want is for the story to be picked up by a proper publisher so it can be better advertised and spread out into the world. Whether or not it makes me any money is secondary, I've already got a day job that I like and it keeps the bills paid. (That's part of why I haven't set up a patreon or anything like that.)<br><br> Anyway, progress remains steady, and things continue to heat up for chapter three. I've been working through a little art block recently, still getting things done and meeting my personal qoutas though. Each week I'm trying to finish at minimum one page and one addition to the site. This week I've added an entry for the cat-people in the creature index, if you're interested in lore stuff. And speaking of lore stuff, the King's pistol here is a "wheel lock" pistol, a muzzle-loading firearm that historically was introduced between the age of matchlocks and flintlocks. They were the first guns that could be concealed and carried while primed and ready to fire, making them ideal for stuff like political assassinations. They were also very expensive and typically only owned by the wealthy. So, it's fitting the King has one, even if they were pretty much obsolete by the time of the flintlock.<br><br> Thanks for reading, more next week.</font></p>
