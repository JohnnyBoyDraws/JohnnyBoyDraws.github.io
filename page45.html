	<h3><font size="+2">23, June 2023</font></h3>

	<p><font size="+1"><h2></h2>Okay the site may look a little wonky today, depends on how quickly Ami and I can iron out the compressed images thing, probably today or tomorrow. (Something we're trying to do to reduce the staggeringly slow load times on some pages of this site.)<br><br>
	Anyways, today we have a new page and <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">a new uploading schedule.</FONT> From here on, you'll see two page releases a week, one on Tuesdays, and one on Fridays. I worry that one page a week of roughly 4-6 panels isn't enough to keep a steady audience engaged, so I figure it's worth going ahead and putting out a little bit more. It's not really an issue on my end, I'm still able to finish pages faster than I release them and I'm still building a surplus, which means it's likely that you'll hear about a printed book before you see the whole thing posted online. Keep in mind the first book will be around 150-200 pages, even at two a week that means you won't see the end posted here or on Webtoon for another 50-70ish weeks. Hopefully, that will encourage people to buy copies.<br><br> 
    Also I've thought it over some more and I think it's in my best interest to go ahead and post the entire series online as well; I've said it before but my end goal has never really been money with this, I just want the story to be easily accessible and enjoyed by readers. What I'd like to see more than anything is the series on the front page of Webtoon, or at a book fair for middle schools, or just simply being discussed by fans. <br><br>
    That's it for today though, I'll have another page this Tuesday and maybe some new creature art for the index by Friday. Thanks for reading.</font></p>
