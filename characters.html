            <img src="images/connor2.png">
            <h3 style="color:red">CONNOR CARTER</h3>
            <p><h2></h2>Connor is a twelve year old human thief with a knack for burglary, pickpocketing, and other nefarious activities. He never knew his parents, and can only guess as to where he actually came from. His features point to Icelandic origin, but he lacks the characteristic blue eyes and was likely born of mixed blood. Childhood was mostly spent begging, working, and eventually stealing just to survive. Having grown up the way he did, Connor doesn't really believe in asking for help, or especially <i>relying</i> on help, from anyone. He appreciates quiet moments to himself, sometimes more than what most people would consider healthy, and can come off as pretty antisocial.<br><br> While a master of thievery, Connor ultimately sees himself as an adventurer, and one day hopes to earn his fortune through raiding dungeons and ancient ruins. (After one last heist, anyway.)</p>
        </div>

            <img src="images/Eliza_Character_Portrait.png">
            <h3 style="color:#15ABDA ">ELIZA B. SHINTO</h3>
            <p><h2></h2>Eliza is a fourteen year old Elven princess, and heir to the Elven Empire. Or she <i>was</i> anyway, before meeting an untimely end and having her soul trapped within a mysterious gemstone. Her mother died from an unfortunate birth complication, with no sons to inherit the throne. Rather than remarry and bear a son, Eliza's father opted instead to train one of his two daughters to rule as a future Empress. Delilah was eldest, but was stricken with a chronic paralytic illness and was unfit to rule... Which left Eliza. In her short years of life, she studied fencing, social etiquette, various literatures, and several foreign languages as her father wished. She was a kind soul that always put herself second to those around her.<br><br>It's largely believed that her death was the result of a political assassination, and started the great war that erupted between Elves and the Kingdoms of Grasslanders.</p>

        <div class = "facilities-col">
            <img src="images/Dath_Character_Portrait.png">
            <h3 style="color:#486322 ">DATH</h3>
            <p><h2></h2></p>Dath is... well, he's Dath. Very little is known for certain regarding his undead origins. He was a normal human once, a talented kickboxer, and unmistakably male from his voice and bone structure. While he estimates himself to have lived over ten-thousand years, he was only really "alive" for twenty or thirty. In his youth, he struck a shady deal with a demon for immortality in which his "bones would walk the earth eternally, until he had enacted his vengeance and found his satisfaction." The details and circumstances around this crooked existence have become foggy with time, while the bargain remains unfulfilled. <br><br> Necromantic magics have been outlawed internationally since the Vampire Wars that ended the Fourth Age. Escaping persecution for his undead existence, Dath has been forced into hiding for the last several hundred years. Though, recent events may call him out of retirement.</p>

        <div class = "facilities-col">
            <img src="images/Meowmi_Character_Portrait.png">
            <h3 style="color:purple">MEOWMI O'DONNEL</h3>
            <p><h2></h2>Meowmi is a thirteen year old 'mewman' (cat-person), with an exceptionally brilliant mind well suited to the magical arts of science and medicine. While gifted logically, she lacks a lot of simpler things like comon sense or situational awareness. Her parents were largely disapproving of her magical inclinations; it was a dangerous field, expensive to study, and it was pretty hard to get your foot in the door career-wise. Despite their best efforts to shelter Meowmi from the fantastical arcane world, she eventually sought out an apprenticeship with a travelling magician all on her own, against their wishes. <br><br> It was ultimately a pretty bad idea though, as the magician was a part of a dastardly road-bandit gang. She <i>was</i> getting more healing experience than ever, at least.</p>
