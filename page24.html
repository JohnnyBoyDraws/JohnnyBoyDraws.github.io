	<h3><font size="+2">14, October 2022</font></h3>

	<p>I finished page 25 later in the same day I posted the last one, so I should be something close to back on schedule now. I've got like a third of page 26 done and I'd like it to have it pretty close to finished by the end of today. It's a lot easier to fall behind with this stuff than I realized, and this serves as a reminder that I'm 100% gonna have to go back to one page a week once training starts on the 24th of Oct. Which means we've only got one more two-page week for quite a while :( 
	<br><br>
	Looking back, there's really not too many pages left in chapter two. I'm not really sure what I'll be calling chapter three yet, I'm torn between something like "The Vault," or "Fatal Folly." (I like the aliteration thing I've been doing for the chapter names so far but I dunno if I can keep that up for the whole series.) Fun fact, this page and page 22 weren't in the rough draft. I thought of the bit with the rain piling up while doing the linework for page 21, (and after rewatching Ace Ventura the other night, admittedly.) I liked it enough to retcon the draft a bit and shoehorn in a couple pages ...And screw up my nice organized page numbers. (Now all my pages after this one are actually two pages ahead of their file names, and I'm far too lazy to go through and rename each individual one.) 
	<br><br>
	That's just another reason I like working with drafts more than freehanding everything as I go. I feel like I have better ideas after I've come up with a concept, and then actually had a chance to take a step back, look at it, and improve upon it. It's not just these new pages either, there have been at least five or six new panels that've been squeezed in over the course of all these new pages. Not to mention, the entire rough draft was written to be very narration heavy, sort of like how chapter one is. That's gone. I'm reluctant to even show my draft to people now because of how much it relied on that narration, and how much more I like this version. I'll probably post a comparison at some point in the "Artsy Stuff" page, if you're really curious though.
	<br><br>
	That's all for today though, more to come this Wednesday. Y'all have a good weekend.</p>
