	<h3><font size="+2">29, October 2022</font></h3>

	<p>So, I've got some bad news. <b>The comic is gonna have to put on hiatus, probably until about mid-January when I graduate from fire-recruit school.</b> I went into it thinking it would be mostly be physical training (and there is a lot of that, for sure.) But it's just as much studying and passing chapter tests as it is throwing on your turnout gear and running towers. Point is, I need to study, and devote a lot of time to studying if I actually want to graduate. My schedule this upcoming week is pretty much the same, every day, for the next twelve weeks: Ready in formation at 7:00 am, clean-up crew, chapter test, lecture, then PT, outta there by 4:00 pm. There's a lot of info we have to cover, and there will literally be chapter tests most every day aside from SCBA week. Not to mention, I've got a limited number of tries on these test. Fail more than 3 times? Fired. I can't even keep up with one page a week on that kind of schedule, and even finding time to put finishing touches on this one was sorta difficult.
	<br><br>
	    I'll still try to periodically upload to the Creature Index or the Artsy Stuff pages, though. Just yesterday I started working on a concept art while on lunch break, and I'll probably post it within a few days when it's finished. There may be long stretches of radio silence from me, and I won't be making changelogs as frequently or even at all. I can assure you though, work on the book will continue, and come January-February I will get back on a more regular schedule with it. If I'm still not posting after January, it means I've probably died on the job or been assassinated by the CIA. 
	<br><br>
	    But, enough about all that. I kinda like that it's this page we end on for a while, sort of a cliffhanger. (I'm sure these next few months will fly by though.) That's all from me for now, hope y'all have a good weekend.</p>
